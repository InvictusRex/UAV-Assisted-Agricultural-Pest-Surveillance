# UAV-Assisted Agricultural Pest Surveillance

_A Comprehensive Literature and Patent Review with Novelty Assessment_

---

## 1. Introduction

The increasing demand for precision agriculture has accelerated the adoption of **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs)** for pest and insect monitoring in farmland. Traditional ground-based inspection methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and prone to delayed detection, which often results in significant yield losses. UAV-based pest detection offers high-frequency, large-area monitoring with minimal labor, enabling timely intervention through **Integrated Pest Management (IPM)** frameworks.

However, challenges remain — particularly in **small-object detection**, **multimodal data fusion**, and **onboard model deployment** under computational constraints. This document surveys existing research papers and patents, identifies gaps, and proposes unique technical contributions with potential for **patentability**.
