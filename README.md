### High accuracy classes:
- Moth (0.99), Snail (1.00), Wasp (0.97), Weevil (1.00), and Ants (0.87) are classified with strong precision.

### Moderate/Confused classes:
- Beetle, Caterpillar, and Earwig show noticeable misclassifications, often being confused with each other.
- Grasshopper and Slug exhibit cross-class confusion (e.g., slug ‚Üî earthworms at 0.29).

### Common confusion trends:
- Beetles and Wasps are frequently mistaken for each other.
- Caterpillar overlaps with Bees and Beetles.
- Earwigs and Earthworms show high mutual misclassification.
